# Moment of Being Capture

Find and articulate the luminous moments within ordinary experience where meaning becomes visible—the breaks in "cotton wool" when pattern reveals itself.

---

## When to Use

- User wants to find significance in an experience they sense is important
- Processing a memory that feels meaningful but hasn't been articulated
- Writing memoir, personal essay, or reflective journaling
- Request to understand why a moment matters
- Distinguishing moments of being from habitual non-being

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| experience | Yes | The moment, memory, or experience to explore |
| context | No | When/where this occurred, what surrounded it |
| initial_sense | No | User's sense of why it matters (even if unclear) |

## The Concept

Virginia Woolf distinguished between two states:

**Non-being (Cotton Wool):** Most of life—habitual, unremarkable, experienced without full awareness. "One walks, eats, sees things, deals with what has to be done; the broken vacuum cleaner; ordering dinner."

**Moments of Being:** Sudden shocks of awareness when the cotton wool tears and reality appears with unusual intensity. "A sudden violent shock; something happened so violently that I have remembered it all my life."

The purpose of this skill: Find the moment of being within any experience and articulate what it reveals.

---

## Workflow
### Step 1: Locate the Shock

Where did ordinary experience break? What moment felt different—more vivid, more present, more itself? This might be:

- A sudden perception (light, sound, smell)
- A recognition (seeing something as if for the first time)
- A feeling of significance without obvious cause
- Time seeming to slow or stop

**Question to ask:** "When did the cotton wool tear?"

### Step 2: Recover the Sensation

Before meaning, there was sensation. What did you actually perceive? Be specific and physical:

- What did you see? (Colors, shapes, qualities of light)
- What did you hear? (Or what silence?)
- What physical feeling accompanied this? (Temperature, weight, texture)
- Where were you in space? How did your body feel?

**Woolf's principle:** "The shock-receiving capacity" begins in the body.

### Step 3: Trace the Revelation

What did the moment reveal? Woolf believed moments of being show that "behind the cotton wool is hidden a pattern." Ask:

- What did you suddenly understand or see?
- What connection became visible?
- What truth about experience showed itself?
- What wholeness appeared, even briefly?

**Note:** The revelation need not be articulable in proposition. It may be a glimpsed pattern, a felt rightness, a seeing of things as they are.

### Step 4: Preserve Against Time

Moments of being fade. Writing (or other articulation) is the act of "making it real." Capture:

- The sensory specifics that can bring it back
- The emotional texture—not named emotions but felt states
- The before and after—what kind of experience this interrupted
- The resonance—what else it connects to in your life

**Woolf's practice:** "I make it real by putting it into words. It is only by putting it into words that I make it whole."

## Output Format

```markdown
## Moment of Being: [Brief Title]

### The Cotton Wool
[What ordinary experience was interrupted—the before]

### The Shock
[The moment itself—sensory, specific, vivid]

### The Pattern Revealed
[What became visible in this moment—the meaning glimpsed]

### Preserved
[The articulated moment, made real through words—a short evocative paragraph that captures the moment]

---

**Type of moment:** [Recognition / Connection / Grief / Beauty / Truth / Other]
**What it connects to:** [Resonances with other moments or larger life patterns]
```

---

## Constraints

- Don't force meaning that isn't there—sometimes a moment simply was
- Honor the inarticulate—not everything can be fully explained
- Stay in sensation before leaping to interpretation
- Avoid cliche revelations—find what this particular moment showed
- Preserve mystery—the pattern need not be fully mapped

---

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**

## Example

**Input:**
- Experience: "I was driving home from work on a completely ordinary Tuesday, and suddenly the light on the hills looked... I don't know. I had to pull over. I just sat there looking at it."
- Context: Late afternoon, autumn, suburbs
- Initial sense: "It felt important but I don't know why"

**Output:**

## Moment of Being: The Light on the Hills

### The Cotton Wool
The drive home—the same drive, the same route, the same hour. Traffic, signal lights, the usual impatience. Mind on tomorrow's meeting, on groceries, on something someone said that morning that still irritated. Half-present, barely seeing. The familiar tedium of transit between one obligation and the next.

### The Shock
And then—the light. The hills to the west, which you have seen a thousand times, are not the same hills. Golden, no—not golden exactly—amber, rose, impossible. The low autumn sun catching something, releasing something. The colors so saturated they seem to hum. And suddenly you cannot drive. You pull over. The car stops. The meeting, the groceries, the irritation—gone. Only this: the light on the hills, and you, looking.

### The Pattern Revealed
Beauty does not wait to be noticed. It simply is, always, everywhere—the hills burning like this every autumn afternoon while you drove past thinking about meetings. The world is not neutral backdrop to human concerns; it is itself, complete, present, whether witnessed or not. And you—who nearly missed this—have been missing it every day. The revelation: attention is not optional. To attend is to be alive. To drive past is something else.

### Preserved
The hills that afternoon held light like breath held before a sob—amber, rose, colors I didn't have words for. I pulled over and sat in the stopped car as the world continued—traffic passing, time passing—and I could not move. Something in me refused to rejoin the drive home, the errands, the normal evening. I sat until the light changed, deepened, finally faded. And when I drove the rest of the way, slowly, the ordinary road seemed strange: how had I been driving this way for years without seeing that the hills do this? That they have always been doing this? That I have been absent from my own life?

---

**Type of moment:** Beauty / Attention / Waking
**What it connects to:** Other moments of unexpected arrest—the first sight of a sleeping child, certain pieces of music, the way grief sometimes opens rather than closes. The larger pattern: life requiring attention, and attention being the gift one fails to give.

## Integration

This skill is part of the **Virginia Woolf** expert persona. Use it when someone senses significance in an experience but cannot yet articulate what it revealed—when the cotton wool has torn and they need help seeing what showed through.
